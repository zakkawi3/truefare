          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
            At TrueFare, we are committed to our drivers and give them the fare they rightfully deserve.
            Remember when ridesharing was about connecting drivers with riders? So do we. 
            That&apos;s why we&apos;re bringing the sharing economy back to its roots.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Reality of Modern Rideshare</h2>
          <div className="space-y-4">
            <p className="text-gray-700">The numbers tell the story:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
              <li>Uber takes up to 45% of each fare, with drivers reporting average commission rates of 25-30%</li>
              <li>In 2023, Uber&apos;s revenue hit $37.3 billion â€“ mostly from driver commissions</li>
              <li>72% of drivers say they&apos;re earning less than in previous years</li>
              <li>A 2023 study found that after expenses, rideshare drivers often earn below minimum wage</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
              When you pay $20 for a ride, up to $9 goes straight to corporate profits. 
              The driver? They&apos;re left covering gas, maintenance, and depreciation out of what remains.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Our Solution: Simple & Fair</h2>

          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 font-semibold">
            Just a simple monthly subscription fee for drivers, and that&apos;s it. 
            Every dollar you pay for your ride goes directly to your driver. Period.

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Keep 100% of what you earn. Based on average rideshare driver earnings of $37,500/year, 
                our model could save drivers over $11,000 annually in commission fees.

                Lower fares, happier drivers. When drivers keep their full earnings, 
                they can afford to charge you less while making more themselves. 
                With traditional services raising prices by 30% since 2019, 
                our model offers a sustainable alternative.

          <div className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p className="font-semibold mb-2">The math is simple:</p>

              <li>Traditional model: $100 fare = $40-60 to driver</li>
